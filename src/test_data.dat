# Example dataset
# 8 digit hex number for sheet id (allows over 2 billion unique ids).
# Immediately after are curly braces ({}). This allows for all the data from that sheet to be stored.
# Within the curly braces are sets of 3 digit hex numbers (which allow up to 4096 questions per sheet) which denote a question id from a particular sheet.
# Immediately after the the question id number is a set of parentheses which contain all the information about the question.
# The parentheses contain a question type id number (2 digit hex for up to 256 types), the answer set, contained within square braces and separated by commas if multiple are there
# 00000000{000(00,[A]),001(00,[E]),002(01,[This is an open response question]),003(01,[More open response responses])}
# Another proposed system is to use indentation to separate data
# Non indented numbers are sheet id numbers
# The next indent is the question id number
# The second space is the question information (consisting of the question type and the question response (in []))
